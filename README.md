# Word Cloud Layout for D3

This is a Wordle-inspired word cloud layout written in JavaScript. It uses
HTML5 canvas and sprite masks to achieve near-interactive speeds.

See [here](http://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/) for an extensive
demonstration along with implementation details.

## Usage

See the samples in `examples/`.

This layout is similar to
[d3.layout.force](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Force-Layout), in that
itâ€™s *asynchronous* and *stateful*.
